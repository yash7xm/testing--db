The indistinguishability relation is defined as follows: two strings x and y are indistinguishable by L if and only if, for every string z, either all three strings xz, yz are in L, or both are not in L. In other words, if we cannot distinguish between two strings based on whether they belong to L or not, then they are equivalent under the indistinguishability relation.

The simulation of a DFA into an NFA requires the use of epsilon transitions to represent the non-determinism of the NFA. The simulation can be done by constructing a new NFA where each state in the DFA is represented by a unique set of states in the NFA, and epsilon transitions are added to represent the transitions that were not present in the original DFA.
